## Questionaire

#Testing module

Questionaire is a testing module that allows you to imput any series of questions and provide multiple choice answers. 

Each slide (or question) has a set time limit to answer the question. 

Once the user selects thier answer, they will be automatically taken to the next question. 

There will be a confirm 

If a user does not answer the question in the alotted time, it will count as a missed question and reported to the final outcome.

In addition to missing the question, 5 seconds will be pulled from the remaining timer. 

Once the questionaire is complete, the user will be prompted to imput thier name or initials and log it to the leaderboard. 

Below is a link to take you to the website:
