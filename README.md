## Questionaire

#Testing module

Questionaire is a testing module that allows you to imput any series of questions and provide multiple choice answers. 

Each slide (or question) has a set time limit to answer the question. 

Once the user selcts thier answer, they will be automatically taken to the next question. 

If a user does not answer the question in the alotted time, it will count as a missed question and reported to the final outcome.

Once the questionaire is complete, the user will be prompted to imput thier name or initials and log it to the leaderboard. 

Initially, the leaderboard will be local. Therefor, it will essentially be beating ones own score to track progress. 

Thank you!
