## Questionaire

#Testing module

Questionaire is a testing module that allows you to imput any series of questions and provide multiple choice answers. 

Each slide (or question) has a set time limit to answer the question. 

Once the user selects thier answer, they will be automatically taken to the next question. 

There will be a confirm 

If a user does not answer the question in the alotted time, it will count as a missed question and reported to the final outcome.

In addition to missing the question, 5 seconds will be pulled from the remaining timer. 

Once the questionaire is complete, the user will be prompted to imput thier name or initials and log it to the leaderboard.
